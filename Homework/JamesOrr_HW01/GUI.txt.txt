This GUI is a simple mail order program. 
It will ask the user to fill in various data fields to order products in an organized manner.

At the top of the order form, you will enter your name in a text box and hit the button next to confirm it.

Below the name section is a drop down menu for the user to choose from multiple products,
alongside a numeric up down tool to select the quantity of the product from 1 to 10. There is another button to confirm it.

Then there is a group box for the user to choose a payment method. There is also a text box next to the "other"
option to write in and select a payment method not listed. Selecting one will immediately deselect another
and confirm the chosen method.

Then there is a date selector for the person to choose when to have the product(s) delivered. 
Choosing the date automatically confirms when it will be sent.

Below that is a text box to enter delivery details. The button next to it will confirm the written details.

Off to the side of these is a large group box that collects the data from the previously mentioned parts.
The entered name, payment method, product and quantity, date of delivery, and delivery details
will be sent here once they are confirmed.

Below the large group box are three button: clear, confirm, and close.
The clear button will reset all of the data in the form to it's default values and clear everything in the order form group box.

The confirm button will check if every field in the order group box is filled in.
	-If one or all of the fields are not filled in, a label will appear to tell the user to enter all of the data.
	-If all of the fields are filled in, the same label will appear to confirm that the order was sent.

Once the user is done with the program, they may click the "Close Program" button
next to the "Confirm Order" button to close the program.
